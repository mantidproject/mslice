MSlice for Mantid
=================

MSlice is a tool for visualizing cuts and slices of inelastic neutron scattering
data. This version uses `Mantid <http://mantidproject.org>`_ to process the data
and plots it using `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_. It is principally a
GUI tool but an commandline interface with a syntax similar to 
`Horace <http://horace.isis.rl.ac.uk>`_ is planned. 

MSlice is still in beta, so please report any bugs to the 
`github pages <https://github.com/mantidproject/mslice>`_. In particular, it is
currently limited to powder (polycrystalline) data. An extension to handle
single crystal data is currently planned.
